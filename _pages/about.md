Just trying to understand.

My professional energy is currently going into making sense of [long-term governance](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

Before that, I spent four years building up the [Swiss community of aspiring effective altruists](https://effectivealtruism.ch/) - analyzing career paths, donation choices, moral philosophy, decision theory, game theory, and human psychology.

Before that, I failed at getting excited about an undergrad program in international relations.

In parallel, I have been continously - and increasingly so - making sense of the world, civilization, path dependencies and future trajectories, interdependencies, and my subjective experience.

I used to be quite carefree until I went vegan for health reasons at 18 and stumbled into the animal rights scene. I realized how much I care about other beings and how much potential there is for life to thrive if humanity plays its cards right. There'll probably be unfathomably more conscious beings in the future and it seems overwhelmingly important that we don't screw them over. 

I think the future is probably going to be amazing. And I want to make that even more probable - by ensuring technological progress happens with future beings in mind.
