I am trying to understand.

My professional energy is currently going into making sense of [long-term governance](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

Before that, I spent four years building up the [Swiss community of aspiring effective altruists](https://effectivealtruism.ch/) - analyzing career paths, donation choices, moral philosophy, decision theory, game theory, and human psychology.

Before that, I failed at getting excited about an undergrad program in international relations.

In parallel, I have been continously - and hopefully increasingly - making sense of the world, civilization, path dependencies and future trajectories, interdependencies, and my subjective experience.
