Just trying to understand.

My professional life is making sense of [long-term governance](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

Before that, I spent four years building up the [Swiss effective altruism community](https://effectivealtruism.ch/) - analyzing career paths, philanthropy, moral philosophy, decision theory, game theory, group rationality, and human psychology.

Before that, I failed at getting excited about an undergrad program in international relations. Probably because I never had to study for anything before and I didn't have an ambitious vision for the future beyond my individual success.

I have also been making sense of the universe, civilization, path dependencies and future trajectories, interdependencies, and my subjective experience. This website exists to collect all of those bits and pieces.

I used to be quite carefree until I went vegan for selfish reasons at 18 and stumbled into the animal rights scene. From there on, it slowly dawned on me that I care a whole lot about life across species, space, and time. There is so much potential in the universe if humanity plays its cards right: unfathomable quantities of incredibly complex conscious experience. Our collective wisdom ought to catch up with our power to create and destroy.

Despite uncertainties, I believe the future will probably be wonderful. Let's make that even more probable.
