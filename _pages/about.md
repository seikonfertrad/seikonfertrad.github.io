Just trying to understand.

My professional energy is currently going into making sense of [long-term governance](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

Before that, I spent four years building up the [Swiss community of aspiring effective altruists](https://effectivealtruism.ch/) - analyzing career paths, donation choices, moral philosophy, decision theory, game theory, and human psychology.

Before that, I failed at getting excited about an undergrad program in international relations.

In parallel, I have been continously - and increasingly so - making sense of the world, civilization, path dependencies and future trajectories, interdependencies, and my subjective experience.

I used to be quite carefree until I went vegan for health reasons, tumbled down the animal rights rabbit-hole, realized I care a lot and concluded that means I should care even more about humans. As it looks like there'll be even more living, feeling beings in the future, it seems overwhelmingly important that we don't screw that up. I think it's probably all going to be fine. And I want to make that even more probable.
