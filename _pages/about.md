This website exists to increasingly collect my~~self~~. 

I care a lot about us humans getting our act together. If humanity plays its cards right, the universe could soon be buzzing with unfathomably rich experience(s).

I was quite ~~carefree~~a dick until my last year of high school, when I went vegan for the wrong reasons. Looking for what to eat forced me into animal advocacy groups, where it dawned on me that I deeply care about life across species, space, and time. And about taking strategic, pragmatic action, instead of signalling my virtuosity.

Seeking friends with shared interests, I encountered Effective Altruism in 2013. Many rabbit holes later, I decided to dedicate my career to future generations.

Despite an urgent need to mitigate global catastrophic risks, I am extremely excited about our civilization. We've come quite far in very little time. The future will probably be wonderful. So let's make that even more probable. 

As of 2021, I'm trying to [improve international risk governance](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

From 2016 to 2020, I built up the [Swiss effective altruism ecosystem](https://effectivealtruism.ch/).

Before that, I failed to sustain motivation for an undergrad in international relations; did a gap year as an au pair and snowboard instructor; grew up in Germany, with a 1-year stint in Tennessee; did many sports and played games.

When not working or modelling inter- and intrapersonal dynamics, I spend my time with loved ones, analyzing matter(s), exploring boundaries, improving structures, lifting weights, mixing music, documenting reflections, cooking, and dancing.
