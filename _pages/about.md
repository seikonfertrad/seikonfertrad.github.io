I am excited about contributing to humanity getting its act together and want to use this site to collect myself. [Humanism has come far in little time](https://ourworldindata.org/problems-and-progress). If we [play our cards right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrMIEz_mSJM), the future will be buzzing with [unfathomably rich experiences](https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/01/18/actually-possible-thoughts-on-utopia). I hope to make that even more probable.

**What I am up to**

As of 2021, I'm working to [improve international risk governance](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

From 2015 to 2020, I helped build up the [Swiss EA ecosystem](https://effectivealtruism.ch/), played around with [modelling the world](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2022/8210732/) and attempted to [understand human potential](https://konrads.link/posts/2019/11/my-favorite-podcasts/), including my own. Before that, I failed to sustain motivation for an undergrad in international relations; did a gap year as an au pair and snowboard instructor; grew (up) in Germany, with a 1-year stint in Tennessee; did many sports and played all sorts of games.

When not working, I enjoy time with loved ones, analyzing matter(s), exploring boundaries, improving structures, lifting weights, mixing music, documenting reflections, art, food, and dance.

**How I ended up here**

In my last year of high school, my nose for na√Øve moral superiority and social differentiation, paired with the desire to eat healthier, made me go vegan. Investigating animal sentience, it dawned on me that I could leverage my privilege for better things than climbing local social status ladders. Seeking friends with shared motivations, I encountered [effective altruism (EA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) in late 2013. Many rabbit holes later, I decided to dedicate my career to the wellbeing of future generations.
