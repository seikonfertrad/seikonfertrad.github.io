I am excited about contributing to humanity getting its act together. This site collects links to provide an overview of how I'm doing so.

If we [play our cards right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrMIEz_mSJM), the future will be buzzing with [unfathomably rich experiences](https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/01/18/actually-possible-thoughts-on-utopia). [Humanism has come far in little time](https://ourworldindata.org/problems-and-progress). I want to make sure that trend continues. 

**What I am up to**

As of 2024, our work is best framed as "frontier AI diplomacy". My most alive side project is [FractalGVA](https://fractalgva.ch/) - developing a walkable, intergenerational neighborhood campus right inside the city.

In 2021, I co-founded the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance to improve international preparedness for [rapid technological change](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

Before that, I helped build up the [Swiss EA ecosystem](https://effectivealtruism.ch/), tried to [model some](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2022/8210732/) of the world, and [understand](https://konrads.link/posts/2019/11/my-favorite-podcasts/) human potential, including my own. Before that, I failed to sustain motivation for an undergrad in international relations; did a gap year as an au pair and snowboard instructor; grew (up) in Germany, with a 1-year stint in Tennessee; did many sports and played all sorts of games.

When not working, I explore the liminal, lift weights, mix music, document reflections, create, and dance.

**How I ended up here**

In my last year of high school, a na√Øve sense of moral superiority paired with the desire to eat healthier and made me go vegan. Investigating animal sentience, it dawned on me that I could leverage my privilege for better things than climbing local social status ladders. Seeking friends with shared motivations, I encountered [effective altruism (EA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) in late 2013. Many rabbit holes later, I became profoundly motivated by the realistic prospects of a radically better future. One where all conscious beings can self-actualize their desires and transcend identity.
