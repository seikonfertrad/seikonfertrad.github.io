This website exists to increasingly collect my~~self~~. 

I care a lot about us humans getting our act together. If humanity plays its cards right, the universe could soon be buzzing with unfathomably rich experience(s).

I was quite ~~carefree~~a jerk until my last year of high school, when I went vegan for the wrong reasons. Looking for how to eat healthily landed me in various animal advocacy groups. Confronted with the everyday horrors people there shared, it dawned on me that I deeply care about life across species, space, and time. And about leveraging my privilege.

Seeking friends with shared motivations, I encountered [effective altruism (EA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) in late 2013. Many rabbit holes later, I decided to dedicate my career to future generations.

Despite my current priority to mitigate looming existential risks, I am extremely excited about our civilization. We've come quite far in very little time. The future will probably be wonderful. So let's make that even more probable. 

As of 2021, I'm working to [improve international risk governance](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

From 2016 to 2020, I focused on building up the [Swiss EA ecosystem](https://effectivealtruism.ch/) and understanding my own path.

Before that, I failed to sustain motivation for an undergrad in international relations; did a gap year as an au pair and snowboard instructor; grew up in Germany, with a 1-year stint in Tennessee; did many sports and played games.

When not working or modelling inter- and intrapersonal dynamics, I spend my time with loved ones, analyzing matter(s), exploring boundaries, improving structures, lifting weights, mixing music, documenting reflections, cooking, and dancing.
