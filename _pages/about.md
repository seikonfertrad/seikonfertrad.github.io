This website exists to increasingly collect my~~self~~. I'm excited about humans getting their act together and think a lot about inter- and intrapersonal dynamics.

I used to be quite carefree until I went vegan for the aesthetics in 2013 and stumbled into the animal rights scene. From there on, it slowly dawned on me that I care a whole lot about life across species, space, and time. And if humanity plays its cards right, the universe will be buzzing with unfathomably rich experiences.

Despite uncertainties, I think the future will probably be wonderful. Let's make that even more probable by ensuring our collective wisdom catches up with our powers to create and destroy.

As of 2021: I'm trying to [improve international risk governance](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

2016-2020: I built up the [Swiss effective altruism ecosystem](https://effectivealtruism.ch/).

Before that, I failed to sustain motivation for an undergrad in international relations; was a snowboard instructor and au pair; grew up in various German cities, with a 1-year stint in Tennessee; did many sports and played games.

I spend most of my free time with loved ones, investigating minds, exploring boundaries, lifting weights, mixing music, documenting reflections, cooking, and dancing.
