This website exists to increasingly collect my~~self~~. 

I care a lot about us humans getting our act together. If humanity plays its cards right, the universe will soon be buzzing with unfathomably rich experiences.

I was quite carefree until my last year of high school, when I went vegan for all the wrong reasons. Looking for recipes, I stumbled across moral philosophy. So it dawned on me that I deeply care about life across species, space, and time.

Despite unprecedented, man-made risks, I am excited about human civilization. We've already come far in very little time. 

The future will probably be wonderful. Let's make that even more probable. 

As of 2021, I'm trying to [improve the governance of our powers to create and destroy](https://simoninstitute.ch/).

From 2016 to 2020, I built up the [Swiss effective altruism ecosystem](https://effectivealtruism.ch/).

Before that, I failed to sustain motivation for an undergrad in international relations; did a gap year as an au pair and snowboard instructor; grew up in Germany, with a 1-year stint in Tennessee; did many sports and played games.

When not working, I spend my time with loved ones, analyzing matter(s), exploring boundaries, improving structures, lifting weights, mixing music, documenting reflections, cooking, and dancing.
