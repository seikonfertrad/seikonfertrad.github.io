Unfortunately, the organizers didn't manage to get me an original recording of me introducing longtermism in English. So [here's the French-interpreted version.](https://youtu.be/DWl7OTLjijA?t=5707)

Here are the [slides and English speaker notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KtLUk62lJg4MmQDl-f8zb63xizbgu4fv/), free to reuse. Many of the slides are adaptated from [Darius Meissner's talk on longtermism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOODsjhYtyg).
