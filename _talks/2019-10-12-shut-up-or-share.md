I talk about our well of common knowledge and how we can maintain it. Also about: cognitive biases, vaccine scepticism, pandemic preparedness, probabilistic thinking, and global priorities. It's a bit too much for 17 minutes. [Watch it here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpOTS0AJWxE)

A gigantic thank you for [the awesome slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12eQT9X2_rtYvpXakpeXupJHFAiPlcN_m/view?usp=sharing) goes to the [artist Mihaela Ciubotaru](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihaela-ciubotaru-38b18678/).

From this one, I concluded that a) I don't like doing monologues and b) it's pretty pointless to give talks in front of large audiences without clear shared interests.
